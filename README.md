# Guy Shemesh

**M.Sc. Student, Weizmann Institute of Science**  
**Shlush Lab â€” Cancer Evolution & Single-Cell Genomics**

> Welcome! Iâ€™m Guy, a masterâ€™s student at the Weizmann Institute. Iâ€™m currently working in the **Shlush Lab**, where we study how cancers â€” especially blood cancers â€” evolve over time, leveraging **single-cell sequencing**, **genomics**, and **computational methods**. Iâ€™m particularly excited about scalable algorithms for variant detection and integrative analysis of tumor microenvironments.

## ðŸ§ª The Shlush Lab (in brief)

The **Shlush Lab** investigates **cancer evolution**, with emphasis on **hematologic malignancies**. The team combines **single-cell technologies**, **longitudinal patient sampling**, and **computational genomics** to uncover how clones emerge, adapt, and resist therapy. This systems view helps identify **early drivers**, **minimal residual disease**, and **precision strategies** that may improve patient outcomes.
